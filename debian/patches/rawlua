Description: use the right version of lua when not using luajit
 When available, we use the luajit for performance. But when this is
 not available (as on hurd mipsel and other architecture), we fallback
 to the raw lua implementation. 
 .
 Upstream embeeds its own copy of lua implementation for that case,
 but we prune it and prefer the system version of lua. 
 . 
 This patch is here to use the correct name of the lua library in that
 case.
